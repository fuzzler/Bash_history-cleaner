# History Cleaner Bash Script

### This file delete identical row from a selected file (passed as parameter on program launch) or from default file (.bash_history)

**Issues:**
 - Try to optimize file analysis (for example delete similar content -> not identical only)
 - Try to optimize operation (it takes a lot...)
 - Extends Menu:
	- add "choose which line you wish to delete"
 - Pass additional parameter after file to be scanned (for example skip presentation and control shortcut and run now!)
